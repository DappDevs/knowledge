# zk-SNARKS

zk-SNARKS, aka "Zero-Knowledge Proofs", is a privacy algorithm that ensures (to a high degree of confidence)
that the result of a calculation was performed correctly and obtains the right answer,
without revealing anything about the answer itself.

It can be used for convincing third parties of eligibility or existance criteria,
without revealing your identity or the value of sensitive parameters.
