# Tokenomics (aka "Crypto-economics")

[Mechanism design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design) is a growing field that every budding crypto-economist must learn.
Additionally, a crypto-economist can adopt control loop parameter estimation and design methods,
particularly using the concepts behind [robust control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_control)
and/or [adaptive control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_control) methodologies.

Using typical control theory terminology, we define the "controller" as the system of smart contracts
that is the means over which users are able to participate in a network,
and the "system" (aka "plant") as a model of the various types of users,
their available actions, and underlying motivations and behavior.

To help aid this level of economic design via the creation of multiple groups of concurrent users (modeled as bots),
we are developing a botnet simulation framework that works with a local testnet [here](https://github.com/fubuloubu/eth-bot),
as well as a suite of analysis and design tools [TBD](no-link).
